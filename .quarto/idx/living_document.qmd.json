This living document was created by students to collect useful practices, workflows, and tips for writing Quarto documents, collaborating with Git, and organizing projects.\n\nIt will evolve as we work on it together, and serve as a reference for your group projects.\n\n---\n\n# Authoring with Quarto\n\n## Anatomy of a Quarto Report\n<!-- TODOs: metadata header, sections, layout options, customization -->\n\n## Basic Formatting & Markdown\n<!-- TODOs: headings, lists, emphasis, code blocks, links, footnotes -->\n\n### Emphasis and Text Styles\n\nIn Markdown and Quarto, text formatting is done by surrounding words or phrases with special symbols. This method makes formatting quick, consistent, and readable even in plain text. It also helps writers focus on content without relying on visual formatting tools.\n\nThe most common symbols are asterisks `*` and tildes `~`. These symbols are placed directly before and after the text that should be formatted.\n\n#### Bold\n\nBold text is created by placing double asterisks around a word or phrase.\n\n```markdown\n**This text is bold**\n```\n\n**This text is bold**\n\n#### Italic\n\nItalic text is created by placing single asterisks around the text. Italic can be used for emphasis, thoughts, or non-English terms.\n\n```markdown\n*This text is italic*\n```\n\n*This text is italic*\n\n#### Strikethrough\n\nStrikethrough text is created using double tildes. This format is useful for marking deletions or outdated information.\n\n```markdown\n~~This text is crossed out~~\n```\n\n~~This text is crossed out~~\n\n#### Combining Styles\n\nIt is also possible to combine multiple formatting styles. For example:\n\n```markdown\n***bold and italic***\n```\n\n***bold and italic***\n\n```markdown\n**~~bold and strikethrough~~**\n```\n\n**~~bold and strikethrough~~**\n\n```markdown\n*~~italic and strikethrough~~*\n```\n\n*~~italic and strikethrough~~*\n\nWhen combining symbols, the order matters: the outermost symbols should match (for example, `**~~text~~**` is correct, while `*~text~*` is not).  \nAlso make sure all opening symbols are properly closed — otherwise, the formatting might not render as expected.\n\nThese combinations allow flexibility in tone:  \n- Use `***text***` when something is **important and personal**  \n- Use `**~~text~~**` when something was once important but is now removed  \n- Use `*~~text~~*` when marking a tentative or soft correction\n \nFor more formatting options, see the [Quarto Markdown Basics documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).\n\n\n## Code Cells and Quarto Options\n<!-- TODOs: basic chunk, inline code, echo, chunk options -->\n\n## Images and Plots\n<!-- TODOs: inserting local images, captions, figure sizing, code-generated plots -->\n\n## Tables\n<!-- TODOs: markdown tables, knitr::kable(), comparison -->\n\n## Citations and Bibliography\n<!-- TODOs: .bib file usage, citation styles, Zotero integration -->\n\n---\n\n## Citations and Bibliography\n\nCitations in Quarto are managed using external bibliography files, typically with a `.bib` extension (in BibTeX format). This method keeps references organized and separates citation data from the main text.\n\n### Step 1: Create a `.bib` file\n\nA `.bib` file contains citation entries such as `@book`, `@article`, or `@misc`. Each entry stores metadata like author, title, and year. This format allows Quarto to format and render citations consistently.\n\nExample entry:\n\n```bibtex\n@book{manning1999,\n  author    = {Christopher D. Manning and Hinrich Schütze},\n  title     = {Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing},\n  year      = {1999},\n  publisher = {MIT Press}\n}\n```\n\nIt is recommended to name the file `references.bib` and place it in the root of the Quarto project folder.\n\n### Step 2: Link the `.bib` file in the YAML header\n\nAdd the following line to the YAML metadata block at the top of the `.qmd` file:\n\n```yaml\nbibliography: references.bib\n```\n\nWe can also include multiple `.bib` files if needed:\n\n```yaml\nbibliography: [references.bib, extra.bib]\n```\n\nThis tells Quarto where to find the citation data.\n\n### Step 3: Add inline citations\n\nUse `@key` to cite a source, where `key` is the BibTeX ID from the `.bib` file.\n\n```markdown\nStatistical NLP gained traction in the 1990s [@manning1999].\n```\n\nTo suppress the author name (for example, in parenthetical form), add a minus sign:\n\n```markdown\nMany advances were based on earlier probabilistic methods [-@manning1999].\n```\n\n### Step 4: Generate the bibliography section\n\nAt the end of document, include a section where the bibliography will be rendered:\n\n```markdown\n## References\n```\n\nQuarto will automatically generate this list using the sources you've cited. If no references section is added manually, it will appear at the end of the document by default.\n\n### Step 5: Change the citation style (Optional)\n\nCitation styles can be changed using the `csl:` option in the YAML block. For example:\n\n```yaml\ncsl: apa.csl\n```\n\nCSL (Citation Style Language) files define formatting rules (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago). Thousands of styles can be downloaded from the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles).\n\nTip: Tools like Zotero (with the Better BibTeX plugin) can help manage and export `.bib` files easily.\n\n### Further Reading and Resources\n\n- [Quarto Documentation – Citations](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html)\n- [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles)\n``` \n\n# Git and Collaborative Workflows\n\n## Branching and Merge Requests\n<!-- TODOs: branch creation, MR checklists, communication -->\n\n## GitHub Desktop\n<!-- TODOs: clone, commit, push, sync conflicts -->\n\n\n## Best Practices\n<!-- TODOs: shared tips, helpful links -->\n\n---\n\n# Project Organization\n\n## Project Structure\n\nUse the following basic template for your project\n\n```md\nproject_name/              # <1>\n├── data/                # <2>\n├── R/                   # <3>\n├── outputs/             # <4>\n│   ├── images/\n│   ├── tables/\n│   └── .../\n├── .gitignore           # <5>\n├── _quarto.yml          # <6>\n├── report.qmd           # <7>\n├── worklog.md           # <8>\n├── README.md            # <9>\n└── project_name.Rproj   # <10>\n```\n1. Project name\n2. Original data used by your project\n3. R scripts for functions and utilities, as well as setup code\n4. All outputs are stored here, with nested folders for images, data, etc. as needed\n5. Git ignore list (configured to skip temporary files)\n6. Quarto configuration file — defines output format, theme, and other global settings\n7. The main project report (Quarto Markdown)\n8. Worklog tracking project member contributions\n9. Project description and instructions\n10. RStudio Project file (if using)\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n- Use RStudio Projects (or similar tool) to organize your project\n- Use GitHub issues, branches, and structured communication channels to organize your work\n  - Establish project roles and responsibilities\n  - Maintain the worklog to track your contributions\n  - Have one `main` branch to represent the latest \"clean\" work you did\n  - Use a single meta-issue to track project progress\n- Use descriptive, consistent file names\n  - Use `snake_case`, avoid spaces or other special characters in file names\n  - Use numerical prefixes (e.g. `01_load_data.R`, `02_clean_data.R`) if scripts need to be executed in particular order\n  - Use `.gitignore` to exclude temporary files that do not need to be versioned\n  - Add `.Rhistory`, `.Rproj.user`, and large intermediate results (e.g. model caches) to `.gitignore`\n- Organize your code\n  - Prefer short, focused chunks with clear purpose\n  - Put large analyses and common utilities into separate scripts (to be stored in `R/`)\n- Never modify raw data files directly\n  - Use spatial separation for generated files (i.e. `outputs/`)\n- Document everything\n  - Create a detailed README with project overview, dependencies, and instructions\n  - Comment your code thoroughly\n  - Document data sources (version, license, how the data was fetched, etc.)\n  - Include a data dictionary (brief structured explanation of all data you use)\n  - Document decisions and assumptions\n- Aim for reproducibility\n  - Document the packages you use (and how you use them)\n  - Always use project-relative file paths (e.g. `data/data.csv` instead of `/Users/taras/Projects/my_project/data`)\n  - Make sure that the code runs on all your machines\n\n\n---\n\n# Coding Style Guide\n\nGood coding style makes your code easier to read, share, and revisit later. The goal is clarity and consistency. This section outlines some simple style rules to follow in our group projects.\n\n## Coding Style\n\n**Structure**\n\n- Use **two-space indentation** — this keeps things compact and readable\n- Use the **pipe operator (`|>`)** to break operations into clear steps\n- Every **dplyr predicate** (like `filter()`, `mutate()`) should start on a **new line**.\n- For long function calls, put each argument on a separate line, with indentation.\n\n**Variables**\n\n- All names should be self-explanatory, be as verbose as necessary (e.g. `penguins_stats_summary` instead of `pgs`)\n- Use **snake_case** for all variable and function names (e.g., `penguin_data`, `filter_species()`)\n- Use different variable names for different data\n\n**Code Chunks**\n\n- Chunks should be compact and focused — ideally under 10–15 lines\n- Avoid “dead code” — don’t include code that isn’t used or explained\n- Large, reusable functions or repeated logic should be outsourced to a shared script (e.g., `R/helpers.R`)\n- Every chunk should fulfill a clear purpose, and its role should be obvious from the context or accompanying comments\n\n**Comments**\n\n- Use comments to explain why something is being done — not just what\n- Avoid repeating the code in your comment\n- Place comments above or beside logical steps to improve clarity\n- Use comment markers (e.g. `# TODO: `, `# CHECK: `) to call attention to things that need to be done\n\n## Example\n\n```r\n#| echo: true\n#| eval: false\n# survey Adelie penguins across the islands                            # <1>\n# note: we need to make sure that we remove all empty (NA) entries\npenguin_adelie_stats <- penguins |>                                    # <2>\n  filter(                                                              # <3>\n    !is.na(bill_length_mm),\n    !is.na(body_mass_g),\n    species == \"Adelie\"\n  ) |>                                                                 # <4>\n  summarize(\n    avg_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm),\n    # centroid_mass() calculates the centroid mass (see discussion),   # <5>\n    # and is defined in R/centroids.R\n    centroid_body_mass = centroid_mass(body_mass_g),\n    .by = island\n  )\n```\n1. Clear comment, explains the purpose of the code\n2. Verbose, self-documenting variable name\n3. Each function call on a separate line, grouped by consitent indentation\n4. Use pipe operator to chain transformations\n5.
